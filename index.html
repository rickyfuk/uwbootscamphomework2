                        My name is Chung Hei Fuk. Everyone called me Ricky. I was born and raised in Hong Kong until I was 18. Subsequently, I moved to California for my college and eventually graduated from UCLA with Math major in 2007. Afterward, I got hired by Cathay Pacific Airways (a Hong Kong based carrier) to work in the operation management. During my 12 years aviation career, I moved to serval departments and finally I moved to Seattle as a duty manager last year. Even though I worked in aviation industry but I was keen on computer and coding since I studied in High School. As such, I decided to take a coding camp in UW to enrich my coding knowledge and make myself prepare to join this industry when the opportunity arise. In the meantime, I am a dedicated person with a family of three. I have been successful at raising a family, and I attribute this success to my ability to plan, schedule, and handle many different tasks at once. This flexibility will help me in the classroom and also my work.

                            In my free time, I usually spend most of my time on cooking and play with my 3-years old son. For some reasons, my mind would be clearer while I am cooking. Hence, I usually spend the cooking time to think where necessary. Apart from that, I loved to play with my son as much as I could. He likes to stick with me and his favorite game is hide and seek. He likes to hide but ask me to pretend not seeing where he is. Moreover, riding bicycle and playing soccer are some of our favorite sport activities, but for soccer, I prefer watching it instead of playing it. My favorite league is English Premier League (EPL) while my favorite team is Manchester United. I watched their game since I was 7. Additionally, I got a lot of precious memory with the game where I watched with my father. Other than this, I watched Chinese drama and movie during some of my leisure time.
